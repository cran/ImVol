Description: Volume prediction is one of challenging task in forestry research. This package is a comprehensive toolset designed for the fitting and validation of various linear and nonlinear allometric equations (Linear, Log-Linear, Inverse, Quadratic, Cubic, Compound, Power and Exponential) used in the prediction of conifer tree volume. This package is particularly useful for forestry professionals, researchers, and resource managers engaged in assessing and estimating the volume of coniferous trees. This package has been developed using the algorithm of Sharma et al. (2017) <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.33786.62407>.
